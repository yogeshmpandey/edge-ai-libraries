Adaptive Token Compressor is a pluggable Python library purpose-built for LLM
agent systems. Through a single unified compressor interface it applies tailored
compression to each part of an agent pipeline — system prompt (harness),
conversation context, and tool schemas — to significantly reduce token usage and
improve inference efficiency on edge hardware.

## Use Cases

- Reducing LLM inference cost in agentic pipelines with large system prompts or
  tool catalogs.
- Compressing tool schemas at runtime so only contextually relevant tools are
  included in the prompt.
- Tracking per-compressor and cross-compressor token savings, latency, and
  compression ratio telemetry.
- Drop-in integration into existing agent frameworks via a factory-based
  compressor API.

## Key Capabilities

- **Unified compressor API** with two specialized types: `harness`
  (conversation messages and system prompt) and `tool` (tool schema selection).
- **HarnessCompressor** — section-aware message compression using hybrid
  rule-based and LLMLingua-2 model-based compression; preserves
  instruction-critical content while reducing token cost.
- **ToolCompressor** — LLM-guided tool selection that scores and filters tool
  schemas from conversation context, with configurable injection placements to
  trade off token savings against prefix-cache hit rate.
- **Lingua Server backends** — supports PyTorch and OpenVINO backends for the
  Lingua compression service, including Intel GPU (XPU) acceleration.
- **CompressionManager** — orchestrates multiple compressors in a single
  pipeline and provides cross-compressor metric aggregation (tokens saved,
  compression ratio, average latency per request).
- **Factory construction** — create and inspect compressors by type name at
  runtime using `create_compressor()`, `available_compressor_types()`, and
  `config_schema()`.

## Get Started

If you want to reduce token usage and improve inference efficiency,
start here with the basics:

- [Installation](./get-started.md#installation)
  — set up the library and required dependencies.
- [Quick Start](./get-started.md#quick-start)
  — run your first compression workflow in just a few steps.

Once it is up and running, explore the full
[Get Started guide](./get-started.md) for compressor metrics,
multi-compressor usage, workflow concepts, configuration options, testing, FAQ,
and additional resources.

## Next Steps

- [Deploy Lingua Server](./lingua-deployment.md) — set up the Lingua backend
  required by HarnessCompressor.
- [Deploy LLM for Tool Prediction](./tool-predictor-deployment.md) — set up
  the predictor service required by ToolCompressor.
- [Release Notes](./release-notes.md) — version history and changelog.
