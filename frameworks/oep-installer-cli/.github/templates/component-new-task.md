## Task: implement `frameworks/oep-installer-cli/module/{{NAME}}/debian`

A new spec file `{{SPEC_FILE}}` was pushed to `main`. Implement the
corresponding installer component following the rules below, then open a
pull request adding `module/{{NAME}}/debian`.

> **Before writing any code**, read `module/README.md` and `profile/README.md`
> in full.  They are the normative reference for function naming, order ranges,
> the `@@HIGHLIGHT` protocol, the `install`/`remove`/`start`/`stop`/`profile`/
> `license` contracts, and helper reuse.  The requirements below do **not**
> restate those rules — they only cover what is not already in those files.

> **Scope fence**: modify only files under `module/{{NAME}}/` (and the
> profile files explicitly requested in the spec file, if any).
> Do **not** touch `common/`, `license/`, `openedge-cli`, `.github/`, or any
> other component's directory.  If a needed helper does not exist in `common/`
> or `license/`, implement the logic locally within the component and note the
> gap in the PR description for a maintainer to decide.

> **Branch/source of truth rule**: start from the current `main`. Do **not**
> resume, cherry-pick from, or otherwise reuse branches belonging to closed
> pull requests. The only authoritative requirement sources are the spec
> embedded below, `module/README.md`, `profile/README.md`, and current `main`.
> If a closed, unmerged PR exists for this component, treat it as **rejected
> prior art** and do not reproduce it. If you reference it, explain in your PR
> description how your implementation differs and why.

{{SPEC_CONTENT}}

### Implementation requirements

- **Function naming** (see `module/README.md`):

   The six interface functions **must** follow the exact pattern:
   ```
   debian_<NN>_profile_{{NAME}}
   debian_<NN>_install_{{NAME}}
   debian_<NN>_remove_{{NAME}}
   debian_<NN>_start_{{NAME}}
   debian_<NN>_stop_{{NAME}}
   debian_<NN>_license_{{NAME}}   # only if the spec requires a click-through license
   debian_<NN>_sbom_{{NAME}}   # only if the component installs system-wide packages
   ```
   `configure_{{NAME}}` and `verify_{{NAME}}` are **conventions, not
   requirements** — they are not enforced by the naming check.  Additional
   helper functions are allowed; the real constraint is **global uniqueness
   across all installer scripts** (CI enforces this).  Suffixing helpers with
   `_{{NAME}}` is the recommended way to ensure uniqueness.

- **File location**: `module/{{NAME}}/debian` for debian specific functions or `module/{{NAME}}/linux` for distribution agnostic functions. The location of the functions does not
  make a difference but at least a `module/{{NAME}}/<ID_LIKE>` file must exist for the OEP bootstrapper to recognize the module.  

- **Functions to implement**:
   - Always implement `install`, `remove`, `start`, and `stop`. Follow `profile/README.md` and `module/README.md` for implementation requirements. 
   - Omit `start`/`stop` **only** when the spec describes a stateless system package with no runtime service, for example, a library or SDK that has no explicit start/stop operation.   
   - Omit `remove` **only** for trivial system packages where removal could cause unintended side-effects (cite `module/curl/debian`).
   - Add `debian_<NN>_license_{{NAME}}` if the spec requires a click-through license; the function must print `@@LICENSE-ID`, `@@LICENSE-TITLE`, and the full license text (use `ensure_license_fetch` if fetching from a URL).
   - Reuse common functions actually defined under common/ or license/. Do not invent new helpers. Available helpers: {{HELPERS_LIST}}
   - Must implement `sbom` if the component installs system-wide packages.  

- **Profile membership**: the spec states whether this component should be added to one or more profiles.
   - If the spec names one or more profiles, **update those `profile/*/debian`
     files directly** in this PR — append the component name to the return
     value of the corresponding `debian_99_profile_<suite>` function.
   - If the spec is silent or says "none", do **not** touch `profile/` and
     note this in the PR description.

- **`set -e` consequence**: all component scripts execute in a `set -e`
   subshell (see `act_helpper` in `common/linux/cli`).  Any command that may
   legitimately fail must be guarded with `|| true`, as done in
   `module/smart_parking/debian`'s `remove` function.

- **`configure_{{NAME}}` idiom**:
   - If a local workspace is required to store the component source files or configurations, define
     a `configure_{{NAME}}` function that sets local workspace, version, and repository variables.
     Use the default workspace location `$(ensure_project_path)/{{NAME}}`.

- **`verify_{{NAME}}` idiom**:
   - Define a `verify_{{NAME}}` function that returns 0 if the component is already correctly
     installed, non-zero otherwise.
   - The `verify_{{NAME}}` function should verify if the component is completely installed, by
     checking the workspace existence, important files such as downloaded videos and models and
     required docker images.

- **Reference implementations**:
    - Full app (profile + install + start + stop + remove): `module/smart_parking/debian`
    - Minimal package (install only): `module/curl/debian`

### Validation before opening the PR

Your responsibility before opening the PR is to pass all **static checks**.
Platform validation on real hardware is performed separately by maintainers
(see *Platform validation* below) — do not claim that platform validation has
passed.

Run the shared validation script and fix every reported issue before pushing:

```bash
.github/scripts/validate-modules.sh module/{{NAME}}
```

This is the same script CI runs (`.github/workflows/validate-modules.yml`), so
a local pass means CI will pass.

In the PR description, include a note such as:
> "Static checks pass. Awaiting the `validate-platform` label for hardware
> validation."

Do **not** state that platform validation passed — you cannot run it.

### Platform validation

Platform validation is performed by a maintainer applying the
`VALIDATE-PLATFORM` label to the PR.  This triggers
`.github/workflows/platform-validate.yml` on a self-hosted runner inside the
corporate lab, which runs the following lifecycle on real hardware:

| Step | What is tested |
|------|---------------|
| install | `openedge-cli install {{NAME}}` must exit 0 |
| install (again) | Idempotency — must exit 0, must not re-run expensive steps |
| install --reinstall | Forced reinstall must exit 0 |
| install --validate | Install + feature validation must exit 0 |
| start + port probe | `openedge-cli start {{NAME}}` must exit 0; declared ports must be reachable |
| stop + port probe | `openedge-cli stop {{NAME}}` must exit 0; ports must be released |
| remove + verify | `openedge-cli remove {{NAME}}` must exit 0; `verify_{{NAME}}` must then fail |

**Your component must therefore:**
- Be fully **idempotent**: the second install must detect the existing state
  via `verify_{{NAME}}` and skip gracefully.
- Support `--reinstall` for forced reinstallation.
- Optionally support `--validate` for sanity feature validation.
- Have a `stop` that fully releases any bound ports.
- Have a `remove` that leaves `verify_{{NAME}}` returning non-zero and
  cleans up the workspace.

If validation fails, you will receive a PR comment addressed to **@copilot**
with the failing step name and the last ~50 lines of the log.  Fix the issue
and push to this branch — the workflow will re-run automatically.
