"""Functional integration tests: drive performance jobs whose input is an
artifact uploaded through ``POST /videos/upload`` or
``POST /images/upload``.

The flow mirrors the way a real user would chain the upload endpoints
with the performance test endpoint:

1. Upload an artifact (video or image archive) and capture the
   server-assigned name from the response.
2. Pick a pipeline variant matching one of the device families reported
   by ``GET /devices`` (CPU/GPU/NPU) so the test runs on whatever
   hardware happens to be available - same convention as the existing
   ``test_performance_job_flow.py``.
3. Fetch the variant's ``pipeline_graph_simple``, patch its ``source``
   node to point at the uploaded artifact, and convert it back to the
   advanced graph form expected by the performance test.
4. Submit a performance job using the inline graph and assert it
   reaches ``COMPLETED`` state with valid metrics.

These tests assume that every default model bundled with the variant is
already installed - the same assumption as ``test_performance_job_flow``.
