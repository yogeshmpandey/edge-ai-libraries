"""Functional tests for ``POST /models/upload``.

These tests upload the two reference OMZ models
(``face-detection-retail-0004`` and
``age-gender-recognition-retail-0013``) under per-session unique
names so they show up as custom (uploaded) models in
``GET /models``. The pipeline test in
``test_models_uploaded_pipeline.py`` then exercises the very same
uploaded models end-to-end through ``/tests/performance`` to lock in
the ``ModelManager`` fallback added in ``graph.py``.
