# Release Notes: Visual Pipeline and Platform Evaluation Tool

Details about the changes, improvements, and known issues in this release of the application.

## 2026.2.0

**Release Date**: September 9, 2026

**New**:

- **New Predefined Pipelines**: Added two new predefined pipelines — People Detection and Tracking
  (using DeepSORT) and a Wind Turbine time-series anomaly detection pipeline.
- **In-app Performance Benchmarking**: Preconfigured benchmark suites (Retail, Metro, Manufacturing) let
  users run repeatable benchmark packs instead of assembling one-off performance tests. Each suite maps
  workloads to specific pipelines and test cases (CPU/GPU/NPU at 1, 4, 8, and 12 streams). Launching a
  suite starts an asynchronous orchestration job that runs test cases sequentially, tracks live progress,
  and prevents concurrent suite runs. Results are aggregated into workload-level and suite-level scores
  with performance, efficiency, and overall components. Individual test runs expose time-series charts for
  frame rate, memory, and CPU usage; finished runs can be exported as CSV and PDF.
- **Performance Testing**: Added a pytest-based performance testing suite for automated benchmarking of
  ViPPET pipelines against a live instance. Driven by YAML presets (`quick`, `default`, `full`) and
  environment variables, invoked via `make test-performance` or `pytest` directly, emitting JSON, CSV,
  and interactive HTML Chart.js reports with FPS, utilization, and power charts.
- **New VLM Models**: Added support for InternVL2-2B INT4 and MiniCPM-v4.5-8B INT4. New Ultralytics
  models are also supported.
- **Machine Vision Camera Support**: Added proof-of-concept support for GigE/GenICam-compliant machine
  vision cameras using `gencamsrc` (generic GenICam) and `pylonsrc` (Basler GStreamer element) sources.
  This POC will be integrated into the upcoming Sensor Manager microservice in the 2026.3 timeframe.
- **Extended Density Benchmarking**: Users can now fix the stream count for one pipeline and automatically
  increase the stream count for a second pipeline class until the platform limit is reached, enabling
  scenarios such as measuring how many secondary analytics streams can run alongside a baseline workload.
- **Sizing Tool Selection Guide**: Added a comparison table between Edge AI Sizing Tool and ViPPET to help
  users choose the right tool, and aligned both tools in terms of look and feel.

## 2026.0.0

**Release Date**: [2026-03-25]

### New Features (2026.0.0)

- **Demo mode**:
  - A dedicated demo page is available at the `/demo` endpoint, providing a streamlined presentation view
    of the application with pre-configured scenarios and adjusted visual styling.

- **Pipeline variants**:
  - Each pipeline can now contain multiple variants (for example CPU, GPU, and NPU), each with its own
    graph definition. Users can switch between variants to quickly match the pipeline to the available
    hardware without creating separate pipelines.
  - Variants are fully integrated across the pipeline editor, performance tests, density tests, and demo mode.

- **Pipeline templates and creation from templates**:
  - Predefined pipeline templates (such as Detect and Detect + Classify) are now available as read-only
    starting points for creating new pipelines.
  - Users can create a new pipeline from a template and customize it by selecting a model, input source,
    and adding tags.

- **Simple view for pipeline graphs**:
  - A simplified pipeline view is now available alongside the advanced graph editor. It hides technical
    GStreamer elements and shows only the key processing steps, making pipelines easier to understand
    and configure for less advanced users.
  - Changes made in the simple view are automatically synchronized with the advanced graph, and vice versa.

- **Redesigned pipeline editor layout**:
  - A refined pipeline nodes view with flow visualization and automatic adjustment to the results charts window.

- **New navigation and updated look and feel**:
  - A new navigation view between pages and an updated overall look and feel across the application.

- **New predefined pipelines**:
  - **Retail analytics**: Face detection, age/gender recognition, YOLO 11n object detection, and
    EfficientNet B0 classification pipelines, each available in CPU and GPU variants.
  - **Pallet defect detection**: AI-powered quality control pipelines for detecting defects on pallets,
    available in CPU, GPU, and NPU variants.
  - **Smart parking**: Parking-space occupancy detection pipelines with color classification support,
    available in CPU, GPU, and NPU variants.
  - All predefined pipelines include matching sample videos and model configurations.

- **Camera discovery and management**:
  - A new camera discovery service automatically detects both USB cameras (via `v4l2-ctl`) and network
    cameras (via the ONVIF protocol with WS-Discovery).
  - Discovered cameras are listed in a dedicated Cameras view, where network cameras can be authenticated
    to retrieve their RTSP stream profiles.
  - In the pipeline editor, users can choose between a video file and a camera as the input source directly
    from a dropdown. Only authenticated network cameras appear in the list.

- **Live pipeline output preview**:
  - A WebRTC-based video player is integrated into the UI, enabling real-time preview of pipeline output
    during execution. Live preview works with both video file and camera inputs.

- **Timed pipeline execution**:
  - Pipelines can now be configured to run for a specified duration. When the video file is shorter than
    the requested time, it loops automatically. When the duration is reached, the pipeline stops gracefully.

- **Redesigned metrics charts**:
  - The performance view now displays up to eight live charts — including GPU frequency, GPU power consumption,
    GPU memory usage, GPU utilization, CPU temperature, CPU frequency, CPU utilization, and CPU power —
    depending on the available hardware. When multiple GPUs are present, users can select a specific device.
  - After a pipeline run completes, the collected metrics and charts remain visible, allowing users to
    review the full run results without data loss. Persistent charts are fully integrated across the
    pipeline editor, performance tests, density tests, and demo mode.

- **Custom gvapython scripts**:
  - Users can now add custom Python scripts to pipelines using the `gvapython` element. A new guide
    explains how to configure and integrate these scripts.

    branches in an interactive view.
  - Pipeline parameters (such as sources, models, and performance-related options) can be inspected and
    modified graphically, with changes propagated to the underlying configuration.

- **Pipeline import and export**:
  - Pipelines can be imported from and exported to configuration files, enabling sharing of configurations between
    environments and easier version control.
  - Exported definitions capture both topology and key parameters, allowing reproducible pipeline setups.

- **Backend and frontend separation**:
  - The application is now structured as a separate backend and frontend, allowing independent development and
    deployment of each part.
  - A fully functional REST API is exposed by the backend, which can be accessed directly by automation scripts or
    indirectly through the UI.

- **Extensible architecture for dynamic pipelines**:
  - The internal architecture has been evolved to support dynamic registration and loading of pipelines.
  - New pipeline types can be added without modifying core components, enabling easier experimentation with
    custom topologies.
