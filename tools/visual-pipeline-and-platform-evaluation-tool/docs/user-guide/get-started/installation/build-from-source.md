# Build from Source

Build the Visual Pipeline and Platform Evaluation Tool from source to customize, debug, or extend its
functionality. In this guide, the following tasks are covered:

- Setting up the development environment.
- Compiling the source code and resolving dependencies.
- Generating a runnable build for local testing or deployment.

This guide is intended for developers working directly with the source code.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following:

- **System requirements**: The system meets the [minimum requirements](./system-requirements.md).
- **Internet access**: The host has outbound internet connectivity. Base images, apt and Python packages, npm
  dependencies, sample videos, and models are downloaded during the build and on first start. Offline or
  air-gapped installation is not supported. See
  [Network Requirements](./system-requirements.md#network-requirements).
- **Docker platform**: **Docker Engine** is installed. On Linux, install it from the Docker apt repository, see
  [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), then complete the
  [post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to run Docker as a non-root user.

  > **Note:** Do not use Docker Desktop on Linux. It runs the Docker daemon inside a virtual machine that is not forwarding GPU device on Linux (yet).

- **Dependencies installed**:
  - **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
  - **Make**: Standard build tool, typically provided by the `build-essential` (or equivalent) package on Linux.

For GPU and/or NPU usage, appropriate drivers must be installed. The recommended method is to use the DLS installation
script, which detects available devices and installs the required drivers. Follow the `Prerequisites` section in
[Install Guide Ubuntu](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/install/install_guide_ubuntu.html#prerequisites).

> **Note:** The same steps apply to Ubuntu 24.04 running under WSL 2 on Windows - run all commands
> inside the WSL distribution. On WSL, only the CPU and GPU (WSL) variants are supported. See
> [System Requirements](./system-requirements.md#windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl).

This guide assumes basic familiarity with Git commands and terminal usage. For more information, see
[Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).

Before building, review the [Pre-Installation Steps](./pre-installation-steps.md) for optional
configuration such as the Hugging Face access token used to download models from the
Hugging Face Hub.

## Steps to Build

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git -b main
   cd edge-ai-libraries/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool
   ```

2. Build and start the application:

   ```bash
   make build run
   ```

   Both `make build` and `make run` automatically invoke `setup_env.sh`, which detects the
   available hardware (CPU/GPU/NPU) and writes the appropriate `.env` file. They also create
   the required directories under `shared/`.

3. Verify that the application is running:

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

4. Access the application:

   Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost` (or `http://<HOST-IP>`) to access
   the Visual Pipeline and Platform Evaluation Tool UI.

5. Access the application API documentation:

   Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost/api/v1/docs` (or `http://<HOST-IP>/api/v1/docs`)
   to access the Swagger UI.

## Stop the application

Stop and remove all running containers:

```bash
make stop
```

Downloaded models and videos under `shared/` are preserved. To also remove
those artifacts, run:

```bash
make clean
```
