# Policy Based Router Usage

This section shows how to use and validate the policy based router in
the Inference Router.

## Routing Model

The router makes a decision in three layers:

1. **Rule**: checks one request feature, such as message content,
   context length, tools, model name, or metadata.
2. **Strategy**: combines rules with AND semantics, then filters
   providers with `provider_selector`.
3. **Policy**: runs strategies in order and selects the final
   provider using `FirstMatch` or `AllMatch`.

If no policy can select a provider, the router falls back to the first
available provider.


## Built-in Rules

Rules are configured in [src/rsd/strategy.yaml](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/blob/main/microservices/inference-router/src/rsd/strategy.yaml)
with the `type` and `param` fields.

| Rule Type | Purpose | Main Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ModelNameRule` | Match the request `model` field | `pattern`, `use_regex` |
| `MessageContentRule` | Match text in messages | `pattern`, `use_regex`, `roles` |
| `ToolCallsRule` | Require or reject tool definitions | `require_tools` |
| `MetadataRule` | Match fields in `extra_body` | `key`, `value` |
| `QueryComplexityScoreRule` | Match a complexity score | `score_range`, `target`, `operator` |
| `QueryComplexityZoneRule` | Bucket the last user message by word count | `zones` |
| `ContextLengthRule` | Bucket the total message content length by character count | `zones` |
| `IntelligentRule` | Map the last user message to index `0` or `1` via the model-based classifier | _(none)_ |

`QueryComplexityScoreRule` is currently a placeholder: it returns the midpoint
of `score_range`, so it does not yet vary with request content.

## Built-in Strategies and Policies

The default strategies are defined in [src/rsd/strategy.yaml](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/blob/main/microservices/inference-router/src/rsd/strategy.yaml):

| Strategy | Trigger | Provider Selector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Planning` | User message contains `plan` | `label: planning`, `capability.complexity >= 0.7` |
| `ContextLengthQuality` | Total context length falls in configured zones | Zone-based `capability.complexity` threshold |
| `ZeroCost` | Always matches | `cost <= 0` |
| `IntelligentRouting` | Classifier maps the last user message to index `0` or `1` | Index-based `label` (`0: local`, `1: cloud`) |

The default policies are defined in [src/rsd/policy.yaml](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/blob/main/microservices/inference-router/src/rsd/policy.yaml):

| Policy | Criterion | Strategy Order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Balanced` | `FirstMatch` | `Planning -> ContextLengthQuality` |
| `CostFirst` | `FirstMatch` | `ZeroCost` |

`FirstMatch` returns the first strategy that can produce a candidate provider.
`AllMatch` runs every strategy and selects a provider that appears in every
candidate list. The default YAML file only uses `FirstMatch`; add an `AllMatch`
policy if you need to test intersection behavior.

## Configure Providers

Routing depends on provider metadata in `config.yaml`. A provider can expose
labels, cost, performance, and capabilities:

```yaml
providers:
  - name: local
    type: hosted_vllm
    model: Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B
    enabled: true
    metadata:
      labels: [planning, local]
      cost: 0
      performance: 0.85
      capability:
        complexity: 0.75
        tool_calling: true
    settings:
      endpoint: http://localhost:5000/v1
```

`provider_selector` supports these fields:

```yaml
provider_selector:
  label: planning
  cost: 0
  capability:
    complexity: 0.7
    tool_calling: true
```

`label`, `cost`, and `capability.complexity` may also be zone maps, for example
`complexity: {0: 0.3, 1: 0.5, 2: 0.7}`. Place `complexity` and `tool_calling`
under `provider_selector.capability`; placing them at the top level is invalid.

## Select a Policy

Choose the active policy in your runtime config:

```yaml
routing:
  policy: Balanced
```

Use the `Balanced` routing policy to prioritize planning tasks and long-context quality.
Use the `CostFirst` routing policy when you prefer free or local providers.

## Intelligent Routing

`IntelligentRule` routes with the intelligent model-based classifier. It uses
the bundled [src/rsd/tools](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/microservices/inference-router/src/rsd/tools/) Qwen3.5 classifier: the last
user message is mapped to index `0` or `1`. A strategy's index-keyed
`provider_selector` then picks a provider. For example, index `0` can require a
provider labelled `local`, and index `1` can require a provider labelled `cloud`.

Reference it from a policy to use it:

```yaml
strategies:
  - name: IntelligentRouting
    description: Route with the intelligent model-based classifier (0 -> local, 1 -> cloud).
    rules:
      - type: IntelligentRule
    provider_selector:
      label:
        0: local
        1: cloud
```

### Install

The classifier and its OpenVINO backend are ordinary dependencies of this
project. Use the normal project install:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Model Location

The OpenVINO classifier model is multi-GB and is not shipped in the package.
Set `IR_OV_MODEL` to the model directory on this host; there is no default
location.

```bash
export IR_OV_MODEL=/opt/models/Qwen3.5-2B-FP16
```

`IR_OV_MODEL` must point to the converted OpenVINO IR directory for the
intelligent classifier. The directory contains the OpenVINO model files (for
the vision-language export used here, `openvino_language_model.xml` and
`openvino_language_model.bin`, openvino_vision_embeddings_*, etc.) and the
matching tokenizer and configuration artifacts that `optimum-intel` can load.

Typical preparation flow:

```bash
optimum-cli export openvino \
  --model /path/to/qwen3.5-intelligent-classifier-checkpoint \
  --weight-format fp16 \
  /opt/models/Qwen3.5-2B-FP16

export IR_OV_MODEL=/opt/models/Qwen3.5-2B-FP16
```

Docker Compose tool uses the same variable: `IR_OV_MODEL` is the model path on
the host, and the compose file mounts it into the container automatically.

```bash
export IR_OV_MODEL=/opt/models/Qwen3.5-2B-FP16
bash scripts/deploy_docker.sh
```

The directory must remain loadable by both
`AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(...)` and
`OVModelForVisualCausalLM.from_pretrained(...)`, so keep the tokenizer,
chat template, model config, and OpenVINO IR files together in that directory.

The classifier is instantiated and loaded once at engine startup and cached, so
the first request pays no classifier cold-start penalty.


## Exercise Routing Behavior

Useful requests to exercise the default policies:

| Goal | Request Shape | Expected Route Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hit `Planning` | User message contains `plan` | Selects a provider with `planning` label and high complexity |
| Hit context zone 0 | Total message content length `0–4000` characters | Requires provider complexity `>= 0.3` |
| Hit context zone 1 | Total message content length `4001–16000` characters  | Requires provider complexity `>= 0.5` |
| Hit context zone 2 | Total message content length `16001–128000` characters  | Requires provider complexity `>= 0.7` |
| Hit `CostFirst` | Sets `routing.policy: CostFirst` | Selects a provider with `cost <= 0` |
| Test fallback | Makes every selector fail | Falls back to the first available provider |

### Intelligent Routing Examples

Simple request → routed to `local` (index `0`):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}]
  }'
```

Complex request → routed to `cloud` (index `1`):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Design a fault-tolerant, horizontally scalable rate limiter for a distributed API gateway. Compare token-bucket vs sliding-window-log, and analyze clock skew, Redis vs local counters, and behavior under network partitions."}]
  }'
```

Route decisions include metadata such as `provider_name`, `policy_name`,
`criterion`, `strategy_name`, and `candidate_count`. Use these fields, logs, or
the metrics endpoint to verify why a provider was selected.
