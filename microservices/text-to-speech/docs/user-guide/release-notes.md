# Release Notes: Text To Speech

This page tracks releases of the Text To Speech microservice. The most
recent release is listed first; older entries are preserved for history.

## Version 2026.2.0

**Release Date:** September 9, 2026

**New:**

- Named voice selection through the `voice` parameter, replacing speaker-index
  based selection with human-readable voice identifiers.
- Voice discovery API (`GET /v1/audio/voices`), including available voices and
  descriptions.
- Configurable default voice support via `models.tts.default_speaker`.
- Speaking-style instructions for Qwen3-TTS through the `instructions` request
  field.

**Improved:**

- Synthesis performance and speech quality: faster generation with more natural
  prosody across supported voices.
- OpenAI API compatibility retained for supported request fields and voice
  handling.

**Known Issues:**

- English-only synthesis; unsupported languages return HTTP `400`.
- The `model` request parameter is accepted for API compatibility but the
  configured service model is always used.
- Unknown voice names return HTTP `400`.

## v1.0.0

**Release Date:** June 2026

Initial release of the Text To Speech microservice: an
OpenAI-API-compatible speech synthesis service with multi-runtime support
and selectable models, built for edge deployment on Intel® hardware.

**New:**

- OpenAI-compatible speech endpoint (`POST /v1/audio/speech`) returning
  either raw `audio/wav` or a JSON envelope with metadata and a
  base64-encoded WAV payload.
- Voice and model metadata endpoint (`GET /v1/audio/voices`) for client
  discovery of available speakers.
- Multi-runtime TTS backends: `openvino` (Intel®-optimized) and `pytorch`.
- Supported models: SpeechT5 (`microsoft/speecht5_tts`) and Qwen3-TTS
  (`Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-CustomVoice`) with `custom_voice` and
  `voice_design` variants.
- Configurable device (`CPU`, `GPU`) and precision (`int8`, `int4`,
  `fp16`, `fp32`) where supported by the runtime/model.
- Optional persistence of synthesized output to `storage/<session_id>/`
  with `X-Session-ID` returned in the response headers.
- Health endpoint (`GET /health`) for readiness probes.
- Models are warm-loaded once per process and reused across requests to
  keep per-request synthesis latency low.
- OpenVINO™ acceleration on Intel® CPUs and integrated/discrete GPUs.
- Single `config.yaml` shared by standalone and container runs, with env
  overrides via `TEXT_TO_SPEECH__...`.
- Docker Compose deployment exposing the API on port `8011`; standalone
  Python mode binds `127.0.0.1:8011` on the host.
- Container runs as a non-root user (UID 1000).

**Known issues:**

- English-only synthesis. Requests with any other language are rejected
  with HTTP `400`.
- The `model` request field is accepted for OpenAI API compatibility but
  is ignored; the service always uses the model defined in `config.yaml`.
- For SpeechT5, `language` is accepted but ignored (English only). The `voice`
  field selects one of the seven bundled speaker embeddings; an unknown name
  returns HTTP `400`.
- Compatibility with the Video Search and Summarization sample
  application will be added in a subsequent release.
