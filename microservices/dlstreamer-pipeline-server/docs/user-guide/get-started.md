# Get Started

- **Time to Complete:** 5 - 15 minutes
- **Programming Language:** Python 3

## Prerequisites

- [System Requirements](./get-started/system-requirements.md)

## Quick try out

Follow the steps in this section to quickly pull the latest pre-built DL Streamer Pipeline Server docker image followed by running a sample usecase.

### Pull the image and start container

- Clone the `Edge-AI-Libraries` repository from Open Edge Platform and change to the docker directory inside DL Streamer Pipeline Server project.

  ```sh
  cd [WORKDIR]
  git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git -b main
  cd edge-ai-libraries/microservices/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/docker
  ```

- To enable GPU/NPU you must first grant the container user access to GPU/NPU device(s). Because Docker Compose does not evaluate shell expressions, you need to determine the `render` group ID on the host system and define/export it as an environment variable **before** running Docker Compose. You can add group ID in `[WORKDIR]/edge-ai-libraries/microservices/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/docker/.env`.
To check the render ID group you can use the command below:

  ```sh
  stat -c "%g" /dev/dri/render* | head -1
  ```

- Pull the image with the latest tag from docker registry:

   ```sh
     # Update DLSTREAMER_PIPELINE_SERVER_IMAGE in <edge-ai-libraries/microservices/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/docker/.env> if necessary
     docker pull "$(grep ^DLSTREAMER_PIPELINE_SERVER_IMAGE= .env | cut -d= -f2-)"
   ```

- Bring up the container:

   ```sh
     docker compose up
   ```

### Run default sample

Once the container is up, we will send a pipeline request to DL Streamer Pipeline Server to run a detection model on a warehouse video. Both the model and video are provided as default sample in the docker image.

We will send the below curl request to run the inference.
It comprises of a source file path, which is `warehouse.avi` in this case, a destination, with metadata directed to a json fine in `/tmp/resuts.jsonl`, and frames streamed over RTSP with the ID `pallet_defect_detection`. Additionally, we will also provide the GETi model path that would be used for detecting defective boxes on the video file.

Open another terminal and send the following curl request
``` sh
    curl http://localhost:8080/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/pallet_defect_detection -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
    "source": {
        "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/warehouse.avi",
        "type": "uri"
    },
    "destination": {
        "metadata": {
            "type": "file",
            "path": "/tmp/results.jsonl",
            "format": "json-lines"
        },
        "frame": {
            "type": "rtsp",
            "path": "pallet_defect_detection"
        }
    },
    "parameters": {
        "detection-properties": {
            "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/geti/pallet_defect_detection/deployment/Detection/model/model.xml",
            "device": "CPU"
        }
    }
}'
```

The REST request will return a pipeline instance ID, for example:
`a6d67224eacc11ec9f360242c0a86003`, which can be used as an identifier to later query the
pipeline status or stop the pipeline instance.

- To view the metadata, open another terminal and run the following command,
  ```sh
    tail -f /tmp/results.jsonl
  ```

- RTSP Stream will be accessible at `rtsp://<SYSTEM_IP_ADDRESS>:8554/pallet_defect_detection`. Users can view this on any media player, e.g. vlc (as a network stream), ffplay, etc.

  ![sample frame RTSP stream](./_assets/sample-pallet-defect-detection.png)

To check the pipeline status and stop the pipeline send the following requests,

 - view the pipeline status that you triggered in the above step.
   ```sh
    curl --location -X GET http://localhost:8080/pipelines/status
   ```

 - stop a running pipeline instance,
   ```sh
    curl --location -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/pipelines/{instance_id}
   ```

Now you have successfully run the DL Streamer Pipeline Server container, sent a curl request to start a pipeline within the microservice which runs the Geti based pallet defect detection model on a sample warehouse video. Then, you have also looked into the status of the pipeline to see if everything worked as expected and eventually stopped the pipeline as well.
